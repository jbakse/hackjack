Grab you deck and get hacking.


## What it is

Hackjack is a two player hacking-themed card game played with a standard 52-card deck.


## How to Play

### Game Sequence Overview

1. Divide the deck into red and black cards. One player takes all the red cards, and the other takes the black.
2. Both players strategically set up their **Servers** and **Attack Decks**.
3. Decide which player takes a turn first with a **Ping Test**.
4. Players alternate taking **Turns** until a player wins by downloading both of their oppenents Aces.


### Server Setup

At the begining of the game each player sets up their "server" by placing cards from their deck in three rows. The first row represents the "firewall" and contains 6 numbered cards. The second row represents the "encryption layer" and contains 5 numbered cards. The thrid row represents your data and contains two aces and three **Honeypot** face cards.

### Attack Deck

### Ping Test

Both players randomly draw a card from their opponents deck. The player whose deck had the lower card goes first. Break ties with redraw. Note that this also gives each player some info about the other player's hand.

### Misc Rules (format into above)
When cards are removed from the server they are placed into the discard pile. If a hacker runs out of cards their turn is over. During a hackers turn they may end their to collect their cards from the discard. (should the hacker be able to collect their cards from the discard if they have no cards but still have a 'move': example the hacker plays their last card and beats a honey pot)

Hackers must play a card to reveal any other card. Cards played on the encryption layer are uploaded to the encryption layer and count towards the encyption tally.



### Honeypots/Traps
Honeypots can be defeated by playing a card of the opposite suit of the honeypot. Opposite/matching suits are: Hearts + Spades and Diamonds + Clubs.

Honeypots can be placed anywhere in the Server




### Things to Play Test/Variations

Use numbered/attack cards as data cards, allows ace to be another type of special card
