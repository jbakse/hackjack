Grab you deck and get hacking.


## What it is

Hackjack is a two player hacking-themed card game played with a standard 52-card deck.


## How to Play

1. Divide the deck into red and black cards. One player takes all the red cards, and the other takes the black.
2. Both players strategically set up their *Servers* and *Attack Decks*.
3. Decide which player takes a turn first with a *Ping Test*.
4. Players alternate taking *Turns* until a player wins by taking both of theri oppenents Aces.


### Server Setup

At the begining of the game each player sets up their "server" by placing cards from their deck in three rows. The first row represents the "firewall" and contains 6 numbered cards. The second row represents the "encryption layer" and contains 5 numbered cards. The thrid row represents your data and contains two aces and three face cards.

### Attack Deck

When you have fully set up your server you will have 10 cards left over. These cards form your *attack deck*. Cards from your *attack deck* are played during your *Turn* to penetrate your opponents defenses and defend your own server.
